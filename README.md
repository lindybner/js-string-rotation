# JavaScript Ticker

A simple JavaScript program that rotates the string 'w3resource' in the right direction. This is achieved by periodically removing one letter from the end of the string and attaching it to the front.

## Exercise

Write a JavaScript program to rotate the string 'w3resource' in the right direction. This is done by periodically removing one letter from the string end and attaching it to the front.

## Output

The initial string is displayed, and the characters rotate to create a dynamic visual effect.

## How It Works

The animateString function is responsible for animating the string rotation. It retrieves the text node within the specified HTML element and periodically updates the text content to create the rotating effect.
